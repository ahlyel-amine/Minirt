#Ray takeover
1- red note:
-- ray traced image are created by generating one ray for each pixel in the frame.
-- <primary ray> or camera ray stand for the rays we cast to the scene.
+ We know that the start from the camera's origin.
+ We will also orient the camera along the negative z-axis.
Our task consists of creating a primary ray for each pixel of the frame. 
This can easily be done by tracing a line starting at the camera's origin and passing through the middle of each pixel. 
We can express this line in the form of a ray whose origin is the camera's origin and whose direction is the vector from the camera's origin to the pixel center.
** To compute the position of a point at the center of a pixel, we need to convert the pixel coordinates which are originally expressed in raster space (the point coordinates are expressed in pixels with the coordinates (0,0) being the top-left corner of the frame) to world space.
-- <secondary ray> are shadows ray.
